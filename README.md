A simple LED I/O board based on an [ESP32-C6 Super Mini](https://www.espboards.dev/esp32/esp32-c6-super-mini/) that allows to switch two LEDs and read back the current status.
It is just a quick solution for [Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften 2025](https://nacht-der-wissenschaften.de/) created in an afternoon alongside with some simple Arduino code to control the LEDs via USB CDC and a 3D printed case.
